/*Reviewer 1:
1. My emulator is stuck, it cannot run any  you of code. So I have been used the web browser.

2. It works very good in the color section, and I notice
you have a tab link to another function when I choose any of the color, I like that one! But it cannot work...I hope the reviewer 2 can run on
his/her emulator. It might works on emulator but not web browser. 

3. I added semicolon in line 71,74,76
which should be
  71 showPhoto(e);
  74 alert('There was a problem accessing the camera');
  76 });

4. I added a semicolon in line 103
which should be
  103    {showTeaVerdict(e.source.TeaColour);});
  
5. The file after correcting since have no error at all, it might able works on emulator, but just still not working on web browser.

What I see is you are very close to the right one even you cannot run on your emulator. Titanium is ..(hateful) and if I can be more 
familiar with Java S I might able to help find the problems.

Good job!
